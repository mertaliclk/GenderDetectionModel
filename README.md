## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a gender classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify facial images into two categories: male and female. The implementation uses TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, with a focus on creating an efficient and accurate classification system.

## ✨ Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Real-time gender classification
- Model evaluation metrics
- Data visualization capabilities
- Support for batch processing

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a facial image dataset with the following characteristics:
- Image dimensions: 200x200 pixels
- Color channels: RGB (3 channels)
- Binary classification: Male (1) and Female (0)
- Dataset includes age and gender annotations

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model uses a CNN architecture with the following components:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Dense layers for classification
- Activation functions: ReLU and Softmax
